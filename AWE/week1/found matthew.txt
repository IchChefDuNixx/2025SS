I wanted to have a get-away with my husband in prague. I had one mission: to find my high school friend Matt. Since I had no cell phone there was no way for us to communicate. I went to the American embassy to ask if he was registered as a resident. But no luck.  Matthew was a pianist so we went to hotels and piano shops to ask around if they had seem him. Still no luck. On the final day, my husband and I took a stroll across the Charles bridge. We watched the street musicians and tourists. This is where I gave up on finding my friend. When we were returning to our car, I decided to take a last glance and actually saw him casually standing in the crowd. We went up to him and everyone laughed. It turned out that he was playing piano for a wedding that evening and had a 2-hour break. Just enough for us to grab a drink.
