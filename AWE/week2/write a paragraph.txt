Being on time in Germany: How 5 minutes early is still unpunctual. When you're going out with friends or were invited to someone's place, the expectation is for you to arrive precisely on time. Being late will make others wait or may delay the event schedule and cause it to be less enjoyable for everyone involved. However, trying to counteract this issue by being early is not an ideal solution. That way you might end up waiting on others for no reason or arrive before a party is fully prepared and make the host uncomfortable.
